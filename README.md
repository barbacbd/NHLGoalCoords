# NHLGoalCoords

The NHL provides all live game data through their new API available free to the public, found at https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1 (using the appropriate endpoints). I am a life long [St. Louis Blues](https://www.nhl.com/blues) fan, and we have definitely had some up and down years. I wanted to determine where my teams' defensive holes were, particularly in net. I expanded it to encompass all goalies. The project will aim to determine if there is a weaker side of the goal and if opponents should target this side more often.
